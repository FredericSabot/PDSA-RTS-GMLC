This folder contains the dynamic data defined for the RTS in Dynawo format (as well as some auxiliary Dynawo files). As no data was available in the RTS-GMLC version, generic data were used instead.

Nothing has to be run in this step, add_dyn_data.py is automatically called by scripts in the 4th step (PDSA).

# Requirements

## DynData

```
python -m pip install pypowsybl lxml
```
